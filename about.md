I am a software engineer, electrical engineer and science enthusiast, amateur sewist, and tiny amigurumi maker.

I work at Stripe. I've previously built things for the New York Times, LinkedIn, Intersil, and the MIT HCI lab.

As the introduction implies, I flip between skills as I discover new things I want to work on. In the last year, Iâ€™ve started a container vegetable garden, learned how to swim and scuba dive, worked at a news organization, made a few dresses and purses, and picked up some woodworking skills.
