This dress was definitely a labor of love, though I'm very happy with the result. To be
clear -- the pattern was fantastically easy, I was just trying to finish this dress in
one marathon 8-hour effort befor a plane flight.

What's that about arbitrary deadlines?

Two versions: muslin that seemed loose, orange poly version that was way too tight.
I suspect that the poly version's French seams were a little too generous. Sad that
I have this beautifully finished dress in a clingy polyester, though. :(

I love the length of the dress and the drape of the rayon -- I can't stop swishing
the skirt around me if I'm standing.

- french seams
- using a rolled hem foot
- pick-stitching a zipper in by hand

## Adjustments

### Decreasing the size of the back

  This took me several tries to get through.


## Skills learned:

- french seaming
- properly inserting an invisible zipper, with a zipper foot
- using a rolled hem foot
