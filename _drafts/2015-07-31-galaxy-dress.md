A few months ago, Valentino put out a space-inspired Pre-Fall 2015 collection that made my jaw drop and my envy rise. (Startorialist [blogged about it here](http://www.startorialist.com/post/127788737980/zandperl-xangeoudemonx-space-inspired).) While I don't normally follow fashion trends closely, galaxy print coming back into style was too good of an opportunity to pass up. I bought this fabric in January, way before the Valentino show, but I can pretend to be fancy.

Around the same time as I saw this, I finally caved and bought the gorgeous By Hand London [Kim dress pattern](http://byhandlondon.com/products/kim-dress), which I'd been eyeing since it first came out. I'm a sucker for a good sweetheart neckline, as the 3 (as-yet unblogged) Cambie dresses I've made show.

I think this pattern and this print are a match made in heaven (space?)

This dress was a total labor of love, though.

I did a 2" FBA on the princess seams, remembering the pain that the [Elisalex dress](/elisa-done-bella-lex/) caused me, using [Mary at Idle Fancy's tutorial](http://www.idlefancy.com/2014/01/sewing-curve-fba-for-princess-seams.html). The drastic FBA led to some really weird pattern pieces, which I'm still not sure I've smoothed out neatly yet.

I then pinched out about an inch out of the back neckline, using [BHL's tutorial](http://byhandlondon.com/blogs/sew-alongs/16990588-kim-dress-sewalong-alterations-fixing-a-tight-or-gapey-back-neckline), and took out about 1/2" of the back bodice to account for my sway back.

These 3 alterations are pretty standard, and I generally make all 3 before muslining a bodice at this point.
