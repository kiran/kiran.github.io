*I've been digging through some of my old internet accounts, and have found some writing from past-me. I think I might start editing/publishing a few pieces, mostly from college essays, just as vignettes of 16-year-old Kiran. I've edited this slightly, to remove some personal(ish) details.*

<big>**Describe the world you come from — for example, your family, community or school — and tell us how your  world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.**</big>

A painting of my world so far would contain a mix of two palettes of colors, completely different, but  oddly, compellingly complementary. 

The first layer, the undercurrent running through the whole picture is the San Francisco Bay Area, where I spent most of my childhood. Both of my parents were working computer/network engineers, and so were nearly all the adults I knew. A few of my earliest memories are of my parents' cubicles, of going to work with them after school every day. Living in the Silicon Valley through the dotcom boom was incredible—I grew up around energy and excitement; new technologies and companies sprung up everywhere. I fell in love with that atmosphere. I enjoy being in the middle of ambitious projects, standing on the bleeding edge of innovation. 

Being far older than my siblings, I have always been expected to contribute a significant amount of time to my family. [...] When I started 8th grade, my family moved to India. 

In 9th grade, a year after the move, I transferred to a school with an advanced math and science program called Ascent Plus, which is where I started learning and doing science, rather than just memorizing ideas. The academics were perfect—I lived for the speed and intensity of the courses. The very first day of class, the chemistry professor walked in, and without any introduction, launched into a lecture on stoichiometry. I sat there, astonished. Chemistry has math in it? Five minutes later, after defining the concept of a mole, he threw several problems at us. I thought I had found heaven. After class, the professor asked me to stay behind, giving me a set of more challenging problems to do. Later, with his encouragement, I picked up some textbooks, and started teaching myself. I had been told that I was “intelligent” before, but that only meant that I put in less effort for a given result; the program and those chemistry classes were the first time that I tried working to my limits. Though Mr. Robertson left a few months later, I continued to learn material at my own pace. 

We were also an incredibly close class. A shared love of science and math (and the work that accompanied it) brought us together. With a little bit of effort, I ended up setting up informal tutoring and study sessions for the program after school and during certain free periods. We would work together on the physics, math, and chemistry problem sets, teaching one another, learning new, elegant, simple methods. Though a spirit of competition did exist, no one would refuse to help with a difficult problem or concept. During one of those study sessions, I looked around and decided that learning as a group was exactly how I worked best. 

My family has moved around a lot, so I have attended 8 schools in 14 years. Due to that constant change, I've become not only adaptable, but also slightly quirky. So, though this painting is a fair representation of my background, done in broad strokes, many, distinctive little details are missing. Only so much would fit, so I couldn't draw in the lovably large family, the extensive book collection, or the crazy friends scattered across the globe, the odd slang we use, and the ambitiously intricate projects we come up with. And I still have millions more details planned.
