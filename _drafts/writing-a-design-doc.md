"A good design document is as valuable as the code you
will write. A design document should be a document that will allow a good
programmer to write working code, even if that programmer doesnâ€™t know
the internals of your system too well. In other words, a design doc should
reflect all the research and brainstorming you did before attempting the coding
task."
