## Materials

- one bag to turn sparkly (I used my Stripe-branded Timbuk2)
- conductive thread
- Gemma
- 4 Neopixels
- coin cell battery case (optional -- you can plug into your laptop, instead)

## Process

## Code

I'm not sure where I want to take this next. I could add a light sensor, so the
bag knows to turn on as it gets dark. I could turn it into a turn signal -- add
4 LEDs on the other side of the bag, and an RF receiver, so I can use a transmitter
on my handlebars.
