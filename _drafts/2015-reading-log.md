## Winter 2015
- **The City and The City** by _China Miéville_
  - Fascinating antifantasy. I wasn't really sold on it while I was reading it, but I can see the appeal now. I hate that I didn't understand the mechanics of the world enough to follow along with the mystery; my favorite parts of mysteries are picking up on the clues and solving the problems alongside the main character.
- **Season of the Witch**, by David Talbot
  - Breathless prose, but amazing stories.
- **Hild**

## Spring 2015
- **Death and Life of Great American Cities**
- **Three Body Problem**
  - Really interesting reading something from cultural China. The nihilism was a really interesting touch, combined with the psychological horror at the beginning. If you do read this, take care to not read synopses/blurbs for the book!
- **Embassytown** by _China Miéville_
	- Like most of China Miéville's books, the ideas he explores stick with me for a very long time. Unlike most of China Miéville's books, I really enjoyed the characters and the plot in this book.
- **House of Suns** by _Alastair Reynolds_
- **Quantum Thief** b
  - Interesting read. Couldn't get a hang of the tone for this.

## Summer 2015
- Golem and the Jinni, Helene Wecker
- Player of Games, Iain Banks
- Use of Weapons, Iain Banks
- Are You My Mother, Alison Bechdel
- Emperor of All Maladies, Siddhartha Mukherjee
- 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke
- The Speed of Dark, Elizabeth Moon
- Six Months, Three Days, Charlie Jane Anders
- Pragmatic Programmer
- The Dispossessed, Ursula Le Guin
	- I loved this book. It's currently my go-to explanation for why I love science fiction -- it enables you to set up a universe where you can explore fun concepts for the length of the novel. Working at a mostly structureless startup transitioning to a proper organization, the pitfalls of structurelessness are eerily familiar.
- Chaos, James Gleick
- Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Oliver Sacks
	- A set of existential horror stories, if you read them that way.
