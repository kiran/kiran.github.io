## SNR

I promised you some cheating of Shannon's Law. Of course, as with most things in physics, even the cheating isn't really cheating; you just adjust your model until the cheating falls within the rules.

It's hard to see how you can improve the SNR -- the FCC limits the maximum signal transmission power at 1W, and there's not much to be done about background noise. Messing with Shannon's law often happens through playing with the SNR in localized ways -- it's possible to have higher power in some areas, as long as the _average_ power comes out to 1W.

### Beamforming

### Spatial Multiplexing

This is truly wild!

## The Future!

When the IEEE set standards of 2mbps nearly 20 years ago, who knew where we might have been today. Where might we be 20 years in the future now?

MU-MIMO: have 4 conversations at once
60 GHz: go way up the bandwidth.
