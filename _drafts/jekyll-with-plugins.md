I'm [kiranb](http://www.ravelry.com/people/kiranb) on Ravelry, if you'd like to follow this stuff outside of this blog!

## Two peas in a pod

From a very tacky-looking pattern. I've made this once before.

## Olivier the Elephant

Hard to put together.

## T-Rex

Ended up diverting from the pattern, and have it plop down.


## Cuddles the Sheep

(Still in progress)
Largest squishy thing I've ever put together. Giant cuddly sheep!
