## Favorites (in approximate order)
1. ✨<span class='loved'>**Emperor of All Maladies**</span>✨, _Siddhartha Mukherjee_
  - A very well-written book that explains the intricate mechanics of cancer in a really approachable way. I can't recommend this enough.

And everything else! These were really good, too.

## Spring 2016
- **Babel-17**, _Samuel R. Delany_
  - Sapir-Whorf like whoa. Reminded me of Ted Chiang's _Story of Your Life_, with a bit of Miéville's _Embassytown_ mixed in.
- **Barrayar**
- **The Idea Factory: Bell Labs**
  - I knew Bell Labs was a Big Deal, but I really didn't know how much modern technology they were responsible for! From transistors to solar cells to lasers to communication satellites to information theory! The last third of the book kind of dragged on, as Bell Labs became increasingly involved with monopoly suits, etc.
  - It's kind of surprising how much of an impact Bell Labs has had on EECS. This book covers a few of the really momentous changes in electrical and systems engineering. A favorite moment -- the giant mylar balloon that was the world's first communications satellite. The last third of the book drags a little, partially because it covers the era when Bell Labs was mired in legal battles.
