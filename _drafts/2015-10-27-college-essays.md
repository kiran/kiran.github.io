### Describe the world you come from — for example, your family, community or school — and tell us how your  world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.

A painting of my world so far would contain a mix of two palettes of colors, completely different, but  oddly, compellingly complementary. 

The first layer, the undercurrent running through the whole picture is the San Francisco Bay Area, where I spent most of my childhood. Both of my parents were working computer engineers, and so were nearly all the adults I knew. A few of my earliest memories are of my father's cubicle, of going to work with him after school every day. Living in the Silicon Valley through the dotcom boom was incredible—I grew up around energy and excitement; new technologies and companies sprung up everywhere. I fell in love with that atmosphere. I enjoy being in the middle of ambitious projects, standing on the bleeding edge of innovation. 

Being far older than my siblings, I have always been expected contribute a significant amount of time to my family. When I started 7th grade, my family decided that living in California with four children was too difficult to continue, so we then moved to India. 

In 9th grade, a year after the move, I transferred to a school with an advanced math and science program called Ascent Plus, which is where I started learning and doing science, rather than just memorizing ideas. The academics were perfect—I lived for the speed and intensity of the courses. The very first day of class, the chemistry professor walked in, and without any introduction, launched into a lecture on stoichiometry. I sat there, astonished. Chemistry has math in it? Five minutes later, after defining the concept of a mole, he threw several problems at us. I thought I had found heaven. After class, the professor asked me to stay behind, giving me a set of more challenging problems to do. Later, with his encouragement, I picked up some textbooks, and started teaching myself. I had been told that I was “intelligent” before, but that only meant that I put in less effort for a given result; the program and those chemistry classes were the first time that I tried working to my limits. Though Mr. Robertson left a few months later, I continued to learn material at my own pace. 

We were also an incredibly close class. A shared love of science and math (and the work that accompanied it) brought us together. With a little bit of effort, I managed to set up tutoring and study sessions for the program after school and during certain free periods. We would work together on the physics, math, and chemistry problem sets, teaching one another, learning new, elegant, simple methods. Though a spirit of competition did exist, no one would refuse to help with a difficult problem or concept. During one of those study sessions, I looked around and decided that learning as a group was exactly how I worked best. 

My family has moved around a lot, so I have attended 8 schools in 14 years. Due to that constant change, I've become not only adaptable, but also slightly quirky. So, though this painting is a fair representation of my background, done in broad strokes, many, distinctive little details are missing. Only so much would fit, so I couldn't draw in the lovably large family, the extensive book collection, or the crazy friends scattered across the globe, the odd slang we use, and the ambitiously intricate projects we come up with. And I still have millions more details planned.

### Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud, and how does it relate to the person you are?

I am fairly self-reliant, especially with academics. Because I've moved often, catching up and adjusting to different educational systems is something I've grown up with. A unique, effective education has come out of the experience, along with independence and adaptability. Though I've always satiated my curiosity by reading through textbooks, I think I only first realized that I can be an effective teacher, both for myself and for other people, when I moved to India. 

The beginning of eighth grade stands out with extreme clarity in my memory. On my first day at a new school in a new country, and three alien languages were thrust upon me—French and Hindi as subjects, and Tamil, as the main spoken language. I came home in tears. Over the course of the year, I learned Hindi, from the script to writing short essays, fairly well, earning high 80's on exams. Knowing how to speak Telugu, a Dravidian language, meant that I could (sometimes) make out what people said in Tamil, and, soon, I could converse fluently with my friends. The script, however, was completely unfamiliar, which made riding public buses slightly difficult. My technique had been to jump on the first bus that came by, ask where it was going, then jump off quickly if I had chosen incorrectly. I got far more bruises and scrapes than I liked from using that method on moving buses. After a while, I began to notice bilingual billboards, with an ad in Tamil and an English transliteration underneath. A month of long bus rides later, and I could read and write in Tamil. 

In the middle of 10th grade, in addition to the chemistry I was studying, I decided to pick up some calculus and physics. Later, when I moved back to California, I tried taking the physics Olympiad, just to apply some of the physics knowledge I had. Pleasant surprise followed pleasant surprise as I qualified for the next stages of the competition. Later, in early May, I was floored when I got a large package in the mail—I had made it to the US Physics Team, and was invited to a training camp in Maryland. It's extremely gratifying that what had started as a mere hobby had brought me to a high level of recognition in the subject, but I know I still have a long way to go, much more to learn. 

Familiarity with my limits means that I know when I'm in over my head and that I do seek help. Self-reliance does not make me a hermit; in fact, I often study in groups, and one of my major extracurricular activities is tutoring. I enjoy taking what I've learned and helping someone else, showing them little tricks that I've learned along the way. I know that I can rely on having the motivation to go through with things. My self-reliance usually translates to an incredible thirst for knowledge and challenges; I enjoy taking the hardest classes I can, constantly probing my limits and pushing them further.
