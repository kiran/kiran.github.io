  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A good friend is getting married in August on Block Island, and we’re spending the week there on vacation. He’s a maritime lawyer, so I had to find something nautical to wear while wandering around this classically New England vacation.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Amity Island in Jaws is a fictional island off the coast of Rhode Island. I’m pretty sure Block Island is basically Amity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sailboat-dress/jaws.jpg" /></p>

<p>Anyway – something nautical, and preferably involving sailing, since this maritime lawyer has been sailing since he could walk. The first time I went sailing was with George in Puerto Rico – we went on a one-week sailing adventure last March!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sailboat-dress/natural-state.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is my natural state. You’ll never get me out of the water!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sailboat-dress/sailboat.jpg" /></p>

<p>Puerto Rico was gorgeous, and sailing from island to island across the Caribbean was the ideal way to vacation. I had to find a print worthy of the captain’s wedding.</p>

<p>When I saw Roisin of Dolly Clackett use a fantastic sailboat fabric, first <a href="http://dollyclackett.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/dont-shoot-until-you-see-green-of-its.html">here</a>, then <a href="http://dollyclackett.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/farewell-and-adieu-to-you-fair-spanish.html">here again</a>, I knew I had to snap it up immediately. It was navy and red, and covered in sailboats.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sailboat-dress/front.jpg" /></p>

<p>I paired the fabric with the <a href="http://www.sewaholicpatterns.com/cambie-dress/">Sewaholic Cambie pattern</a>. This dress doesn’t need any introductions – it’s a darling of thousands of sewing blogs, and it’s easy to see why. I muslined this quickly in a grey polka-dotted Japanese cotton (unlined, unblogged, but worn fairly often), then cut into this fabric.</p>

<p>As you can tell, I didn’t really bother with seam matching, which ended up working out in the end, because I made a ton of adjustments to the finished garment. Muslining doesn’t really help if you don’t bother taking note of the adjustments you make. :P</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sailboat-dress/back.jpg" /></p>

<p>When I was hemming this dress, I left the lining a tiny bit longer than the main skirt. I meant to eventually pick up some lace to hem the lining, so a little bit of the lace peeked out under the skirt, but never got around to this. You can kind of see the serged end peeking out. It looks a bit sloppy, but I actually kind of like the effect.</p>

<h2 id="adjustments">Adjustments</h2>

<p>You can kind of see the muslin in this picture!</p>

<p><img src="/images/sailboat-dress/muslin.jpg" /></p>

<p>As usual, I did a 2” FBA on the bodice, shortened it by about 1/2”, and did a quick swayback adjustment. The dress ended up nearly 2 inches too big after I finished it – I’m not sure where the extra space came from, but this seems to be a problem I have with dresses in general. I think I just like less ease in my dresses than most things are drafted for!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sailboat-dress/driftwood.jpg" /></p>

<p>(this looks larger than I’d bargained for.)</p>

<p>After wearing it to work, I came home, drank half a bottle of wine, took off my dress, and cut off 1” off of each side of the back seam.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sailboat-dress/returning-driftwood.jpg" /></p>

<p>Just ran it through the serger. No measuring.</p>

<p>This could have gone horribly wrong, and I’m surprised that the sheer level of YOLO involved worked out in the end. Living dangerously works out sometimes.</p>

<p>I also ended up taking about 1” off the strap lengths, which is becoming a routine adjustment, too. I really like that the sleeves are attached last, which makes my bevy of narrow shoulder/dowager’s hump/who knows what adjustments super easy!</p>

<h2 id="innards">Innards</h2>

<p>The dress is fully-lined (my first!), and Tasia’s instructions are top-notch. I lined the dress with a delightfully soft grey cotton lawn from Stonemountain and Daughter. The lining is machine-stitched in, which is a technique I’ve been using on all the lined bodices I’ve made since. The less hand-stitching I have to do, the happier I am.</p>

<p>Excuse the wrinkles – I took this photo after wearing the dress all day.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/sailboat-dress/innards.jpg" width="350" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/sailboat-dress/innards-back.jpg" width="350" /></p>

<p>This dress is almost reversible!</p>

<p>This dress has had very heavy rotation in my wardrobe – it’s a lovely fit, and the weight of the fabric is perfect. I totally understand now why Michael Miller prints are so popular. I’m looking forward to a few more Cambies, including a planned wedding-guest dress!</p>

<p><strong>Fabric</strong> //</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 yards of “Out to Sea” by Sarah Jane for Michael Miller</li>
  <li>2 yards of a grey cotton lawn</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pattern</strong> // <a href="http://www.sewaholicpatterns.com/cambie-dress/">Sewaholic’s Cambie</a></p>

<p><strong>Sizing</strong> //
My size was all over the place: I cut a size 8, did a large FBA on the bodice, then took out 1” off the back.</p>
