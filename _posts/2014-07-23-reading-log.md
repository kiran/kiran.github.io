It's been a while since I've attempted to keep a reading journal, so here goes.
This log will include about a year's backlog. (Bolded entries are particularly
loved.)

## In progress:

- Man in the High Castle, Philip K. Dick
- Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty
- **The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes** (fantastic, but heavy. stalled)

## Summer '14:

- Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel (rich characters; hard to follow at times)
- Perdido Street Station, China Mi√©ville (great world, very meh characters)

## Winter '13:

Last winter, I found myself indoors in Albany for most of Christmas. I got a lot
of reading done, mostly light and fluffy things.

- **The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Michael Chabon**
- Brilliance, Marcus Sakey (meh)
- Divergent, Veronica Roth (hated it)
- Exhalation, Ted Chiang
- **Story of Your Life and Others, Ted Chiang** (loved)
- Lifecycle of Software Objects, Ted Chiang (decent)
- The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Diaz
- **Ancillary Justice, Ann Lecke** (loved)
- City of Thieves, David Benioff (good)
- Wool, Hugh Howey (meh)
- The Book Thief, Markus Zusak (good for YA)

## Summer/Fall '13
- Play It As It Lays, Joan Didion** (well-depicted depression; hard to read)
- The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood (good, but tropey)
- American Gods, Neil Gaiman (amusing)
- The Windup Girl, Paolo Bacigalupi (great ideas, not the best execution.
sexual degradation as a plot device is gross.)
- **White Noise, Don DeLillo**
- Life of Pi, Yann Martel (great)
- Cloud Atlas, David Mitchell (really liked the format.)
