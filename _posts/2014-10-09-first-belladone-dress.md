I'm super pleased with this dress! I made this to wear to work, mostly, and I
felt like a superhero telling people that I made it. It's a very comfortable
dress, but it ended up with a little more ease than I'd like. (More on that later.)

(Sorry for the awful picture quality -- it's a camera phone at night. I'll do better
next time, when I actually have time to take photos!)

I'm glad I made the effort to sew together a muslin first! I totally misread my
measurements, and also had to make a few adjustments to my pattern. It fits reasonably
well now, though!

I'm totally in love with Deer & Doe's pattern packaging and quality. The pattern paper
is gorgeous, and the pattern instructions were incredibly easy to follow. The dress
is a surprisingly quick sew, with a huge payoff from the cutout back.

Also, I'd like to try this in a lighter fabric -- I think the skirt would drape beautifully.
I'm super excited about this pattern, especially now that I have a muslin that ~mostly
fits. Looking forward to stamping out tons more of these!

**Fabric** // Stretch cotton twill in coral from Fabric Outlet in SF

**Pattern** // Deer and Doe's [Belladone](http://boutique.deer-and-doe.fr/2-dresses-belladone-dress.html)

**Sizing** //
My size was all over the place: I cut the front bodice at a 40, the back at a 36,
and the skirt at a 42. Once I made my first muslin, I realized that I actually
wanted to cut a 36 all around, and do an FBA on the front bodice. This dress has
a little more ease in it than I'd like because of this, but it's a comfy dress!
I think I'd like to take the dress in at the waist more dramatically.


## Adjustments

### Sway back (bunching at the small of my back)

  Also, because my back is weird, I had to cut out a bunch of fabric in the back to
make a sway back adjustment. This is the first time I've heard the term, and now I'm
seeing the issue in all the ready-to-wear clothes I own! In the future, I know to
cut the muslin down while the darts are still basted -- I ended up with a wonky bottom
seam in the end. :/

### Shoulder/back piece sizing

  I also had to cut down the shoulder length a little, and fix the back flaps so they weren't
quite so big. I followed [Lauren's advice (on lladybird)](http://lladybird.com/2013/07/29/completed-a-stripey-belladone/)
to fix this, described near the end of the post.

  I think the back pieces fit pretty well now, though! Ignore the bunching at the zipper, please :(.

### Larger pockets

  Who doesn't need larger pockets? :) I wanted to make sure I could fit my giant phone comfortably
  tucked away in the pockets, so I increased the size on both the pocket facing and hip yoke pieces.

## Skills learned:

- First full dress!
- First time inserting an invisible zipper. (I should probably buy a zipper foot.)
- Relearned working with bias tape
- First muslin I fitted myself
- Using facing
- Blind stitch the hem
