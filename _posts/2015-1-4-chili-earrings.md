While wandering through Boston's South End today, Harold and I found a bead and yarn shop, appropriately named Bead + Fiber. We found a bunch of chili-shaped beads, and couldn't resist picking up supplies to make tiny chili earrings.

The total cost was about $4 -- $1 for the pair of earring hooks, $2 for the beads, and 60c for the jump rings. This took less than 5 minutes to put together, and I kind of want to make alll the jewelry now.

These were super easy -- we bent the jump rings into D-rings, hooked them onto the earring hooks, "threaded" the beads onto the rings, and pressed the rings shut.

Here's how they look on me:
