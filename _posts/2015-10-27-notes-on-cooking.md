*I've been digging through some of my old internet accounts, and have found some writing from past-me. I think I might start editing/publishing a few pieces, mostly from college essays, just as vignettes of 16-year-old Kiran.*

<big>**We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do for the pleasure of it. (100 words or fewer)**<big>

Cooking is magic. See the eggplants? See the tofu? Now, here's a stoveâ€”watch carefully. I have dinner! The food I make comes from many cuisines, often including imaginary ones. When I do use a recipe, there is one rule I always abide by: Never follow the instructions exactly. One unexpected ingredient* can make a dish. Every now and then, though, after hours working on the meal, I end up with inedible messes. Ingredients don't always combine the way I intended, but massive disasters are actually half the fun. And also what PB&J is meant for.

- *Ed. note, almost a decade later: I've always loved spicy food. I had a good friend review this essay when I first wrote it, and his response was perfect:
  - "unexpected" ... [SURPRISE CAPSAICIN!]?
