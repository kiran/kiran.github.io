This wasn't a great year for books -- between a short commute and a new hobby, my reading habits kind of fell by the wayside. As a consequence, I didn't really finish (or even start!) books that I didn't love, and ended up getting through 27.

Also, as I discovered new authors or series, I binge-read my way through their catalog. There's a lot of repeats, and a lot of discovery of classic science fiction authors. :)

This has some overlap with the last log I posted, since I'm trying to do a year's retrospective.

## Winter '14:

Like last winter, I visited Albany for Christmas. Unlike last Christmas, the weather
was sunny and gorgeous. so I didn't spend quite as much time reading.

- **Fire Upon the Deep** by _Vernor Vinge_ (loved)
  - Slightly cartoonish villians, but an _amazing_ universe where fundamental physical constants (namely, the speed of light) differ throughout the universe.
- **Deepness in the Sky** by _Vernor Vinge_ (loved)
  - In comparison to _Fire Upon the Deep_, this has a bit of a claustrophobic feel, since its known universe is bound by the speed of light. The characters are more believable, and the tiny spider civilization is adorable.
- **CivilWarLand in Bad Decline** by _George Saunders_ (decent, but depressing)
  - Short story collection. Nearly every story ended with the protagonists' suicide, and in nearly every case you understood the decision. Its commitment to resignation and recognition of futility is amazing, but wasn't the right book for me at the time.
- **Tenth of December**, _George Saunders_ (decent)
  - less terrifying than _CivilWarLand_!
- **The Peripheral** by _William Gibson_ (good)
  - a little dorky (omg drones! gaming! virtual reality! extra-smartphones!), but great regardless.
- **Ancillary Sword**, _Ann Leckie_ (good)
  - The sequel to the fantastic **Ancillary Justice** from last year, this focuses on the spaceship protagonist in a social justice-y setting.

## Fall '14:

- **Copenhagen** by _Michael Frayn_ (loved)
  - A fantastic 2-act play, going over a meeting between Heisenberg (then leading the German nuclear bomb effort) and Bohr in 1941. The characters revisit the meeting several times. This is post-modern historical fiction about modern physics -- perfect Kiran bait!
- **Blindsight** by _Peter Watts_ (loved)
  - This was probably the standout book for this year for me. Written in something resembling English by someone resembling a human, _Blindsight_ explores themes of consciousness, sentience, and intelligence. Has a tendency to go "OMG THEN HE REALIZED--," without really revealing the final realization. I understand that he's trying to not condescend, but it's a little annoying after the 30th time.
- **Echopraxia** by _Peter Watts_ (loved)
  - Sequel to _Blindsight_, above. Still AMAZING, but didn't grab me as much as the original (which is a super high bar to meet). Similar crazy insights at the end, though.
- **Glasshouse** by _Charles Stross_ (decent)
  - Exploring gender roles and peer pressure via science fiction. I didn't love this as much as most people, but I can't put my finger on why. Still a good read.
- **The Giver** by _Lois Lowry_ (~fine)
  - I somehow missed this book in middle school.

## Spring/Summer '14:

- **Wolf Hall** by _Hilary Mantel_ (great, but hard)
  - Rich characters; non-chronological stream-of-consciousness narrative hard to follow at times. Fascinating seeing a sympathetic Thomas Cromwell.
- **Perdido Street Station** by _China Mi√©ville_ (great world)
  - great world, very meh characters.
- **Americanah** by _Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie_ (loved)
  - Great tale of the immigrant experience. I've experienced many of the anecdotes in the book. Only nitpick -- for a story with such a fantastic protagonist, she seemed a little too defined by her romantic relationships.
- **The Martian** by _Andy Weir_ (good)
  - Fun quick read. Explores how easily technology can be repurposed. Challenges were dealt in a little too pat of a manner -- "oh no I have no food; here's a potato I happened to bring to space"
- **Man in the High Castle** by _Philip K. Dick_ (???)
  - decent alternate history narrative. I'm still torn about how I feel about PKD's stuff.

## Early 2014 (repeated [previously](/summer-reading-log-2014/))

I went on a huge Ted Chiang kick here.

- **Exhalation** by _Ted Chiang_ (good)
  - Not his best, but a fun exploration of alternative life systems.
- **Lifecycle of Software Objects** by _Ted Chiang_ (decent)
- **The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling** by _Ted Chiang_ (loved)
  - Now that I look back on it, I loved this story. _Black Mirror_ tried doing something like this with "The Entire History of you," but to much less effect. [Available to read online](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang).
- **Wool** by _Hugh Howey_ (meh)
- **The Book Thief** by _Markus Zusak_ (good for YA)

## Stalled :(

- **If on a winter's night a traveler** by _Italo Calvino_
- **Bring Up the Bodies** by _Hilary Mantel_
  - argh, such a hard (but good) read. I hear this goes faster than _Wolf Hall_, but I'm a little exhausted by that book.
- **Lies of Locke Lamora** by _Scott Lynch_
- **Capital** by _Thomas Picketty_
- **Neverwhere** by _Neil Gaiman_

## Started

- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**
- **Pragmatic Programmer**
