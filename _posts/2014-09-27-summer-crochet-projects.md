I'm [kiranb](http://www.ravelry.com/people/kiranb) on Ravelry, if you'd like to follow this stuff outside of this blog!
Ravelry is basically github for needlecrafts, but better suited -- people can leave reviews on the difficulties of a pattern,
point out errata, and post photos of their final projects.

## Two peas in a pod

From a very [tacky-looking pattern](www.lionbrand.com/patterns/80308AD.html) from Lion Brand. I love that there's no
sewing to this pattern, so I've made this several times before.

## Olivier the Elephant

This is an adorable pattern, but it's hard to put together. The head is also way too large for the body, so I ended up stuffing
the legs with pennies to weigh it down.

I left the pieces with [Harold](www.haroldbot.com) and told him to sew it together instead. He finished it for me!

## T-Rex

The pattern was from [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/amigurumi-tyrannosaurus-rex-dinosaur).
This was a very fun project! The body came together very quickly, and I love the shaping of the back. I ended up losing
patience with the hands, and omitted the claws.

Also, instead of having the T-Rex standing up, I sewed on the legs so that it plopped down in front of my computer.
