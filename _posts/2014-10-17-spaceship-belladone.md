I am beyond pleased with this dress! This actually fits! It fits so well!

Also, it's covered in little spaceships and formulas for deriving orbital
velocities.

The Stripe systems team has a weekly sync-up that we call "SPACESHIP," after watching the
lego movie. I can't wait to take my spaceship dress to a SPACESHIP.

I've been flipping through [Roisin's blog](http://dollyclackett.blogspot.com/),
and am seriously coveting all of the amazing patterns and designs she puts together.
One late night, I ended up looking for fabric stores online,
and stumbled on [Stash Fabrics](http://www.stashfabrics.com).

Fifteen minutes in, I was hooked. Their selection's amazing! They have the most
adorable prints and colors and organization. Icing on the cake? They're a Stripe
merchant!

I was a little worried about the "quilting weight" cotton -- I've only ever seen
this to mean nearly transparent fabric with a poor hand and drape. This cotton is
amazing! I have 5 more yards in different patterns, from different designers that
I can't wait to cut into.

## Adjustments

### Cinching the waist

  I graded down the side seams on the front bodice by about an inch or two. I really
  wish I had done this on a muslin, or on the pattern pieces, because this fits incredibly
  well, and I have no way of reproducing this fit reliably. :(

  I decreased the front waistband pieces to compensate for the bodice, and took an inch off
  the side seams on the front skirt pieces.

### Decreasing the size of the back

  I increased the width of the back skirt darts to fit the smaller back waistband. Success!
  No weird bunching at the zipper!
  I also had to take off a half inch on the back seams of the skirt, since I didn't measure
  the dart correctly.
  Wow. Much math. Very science.


## Skills learned:

- none, but perfected many of the skills from the first Belladone
