In April, several of my coworkers and I decided to head to Budapest for [CraftConf](http://craft-conf.com/2015), which had a great speaker line-up. They offered diversity tickets, which made the trip actually affordable -- tickets were almost 40% off for a 2-pack if you signed up with someone who identified as a different gender from you. Also, it's really hard to say no to a trip to Budapest. The conference itself was really well-produced and organized, especially since it's only in its second year.

So! I knew I'd be going to Budapest in about a month, and Budapest is famous for its thermal baths. Knowing that I'd be spending hours lounging around in pools, I did what any sane person would do. I made a bikini!

After making several (as-yet unblogged) versions of [Cloth Habit's Watson Bra](http://shop.clothhabit.com/products/watson-bra-bikini), I knew this was the perfect pattern for a long-line bikini top. (I traced off a RTW bikini bottom for the other half of the pattern.) Though this was technically not a swimsuit pattern (it's meant for lingerie), it didn't take too much tweaking to make a lined swimsuit out of it.

Since I've made the pattern several times over, I was pretty confident with the fit and shape of it, and was fairly certain that it'd work well as swimwear. I sourced some swimsuit lycra and lining, and replaced some of the more finicky bra notiions with swimwear ones. I followed [this swimalong](http://threedresses.org/2013/05/01/swimalong-2013-welcome/) for tips on how to convert patterns to be suitable for swimwear.


So, for pattern modifications:

## 1. Swimwear needs lining.

I cut a copy of every pattern piece out of nude swimwear lining, and managed to origami all the seams so there are no exposed seams anywhere. This took a lot of 2 am head-scratching, and fancy folding and twisting -- I'm really happy with the end result. I also slipped in molded foam cups using [this tutorial](http://threedresses.org/2013/06/14/swimalong-about-swim-cups/).

I didn't want the top-stitching to overwhelm the pattern and colors, so I used invisible thread. This stuff looks exactly like fishing line, and is a little scratchy. Not sure this was the best decision, but it looks great!

## 2. Stabilizing

I didn't want to use powermesh for the back band, and also needed some way to stabilize the cradle to keep it from distorting. I used a double layer of the lycra to ~stabilize both the cradle and the back band, which worked great! The lycra I'm using is very firm, and doesn't have that much stretch when doubled.

## 3. Straps, elastic, and notions.

The elastic, especially, is crucial to replace -- normal, non-braided lingerie elastic has a tendency to stretch out in water, which is bad news bears. I bought braided elastic, and turned all the elastic to the inside, for a nice clean finish. (This is similar to attaching lingerie elastic, but I attached the elastic to the inside, then folded it over again to topstitch.) The straps are normal bra elastic covered in the swimsuit lycra, using [this tutorial](http://www.adaspragg.com/2013/08/22/diy-detachable-swim-straps/) for making long, skinny spaghetti straps. I was a little worried about the straps stretching out in water, but they seem to hold up great.

Dealing with the long-line back was kind of a pain. I initially scooped out the strap to fit my 1" clear swimsuit hook, but it looked really unbalanced to have a 3" back band swoop down to 1" over my back. To fix this, I ended up adding a second band and hook at the top of the back band. I'm really happy with the look of this, especially since it kind of echoes the doubled-up straps above it. It also provides so much more support!

A note -- the dressform I'm using to model the swimsuit is a friend's, so it's a different size/shape than I am. Luckily, most of the swimsuit is stretchy enough that it ~mostly fits on the dressform.

I've worn this swimsuit several times now, and it's held up to sulfurous thermal baths and the wild waves of the Pacific. It fits like a glove, and I'm really happy with the absurd print!
