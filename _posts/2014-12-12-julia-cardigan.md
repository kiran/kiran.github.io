I wear cardigans constantly, so I've been itching to make cardigans for a while, but I really don't have the patience to knit one. When the Perfect Pattern Parcel #6 came out, I was really excited to see the Julia cardigan pattern. After seeing [Julia Bobbin's version](http://www.juliabobbin.com/2014/10/pattern-parcel-6-julia-cardigan-and-bump.html), I desperately wanted a black sequined cardigan. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the right fabric at Fabric Outlet, so I settled for this (much more versatile) sheer black slub knit. I'm excited with how this turned out, since this is only my second project with knits on a sewing machine -- the Marlborough bra was the first.

...I might be a little overambitious sometimes. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

If the background here looks familiar, it's because I took the photos at the same time as the [Bicycle Belladone](/bicycle-belladone) photos. I'm still trying to figure out if I should sort my blog posts by project creation date, or blogging date. I realize that it totally messes up RSS feeds if I insert posts randomly, but the neat-freak part of me really wants to organize this chronologically, as my sewing skill increases. It's the same motivation that leads to me obsessively `git rebase`ing everything.

Clearly, the answer is for me to just suck it up and blog things as I make them.

I'm a big fan of this pattern -- it was really easy to put together. Easing the sleeves was suuuper easy because of the stretch -- no fiddly matching notches and curves while stretching and hoping.

I'm not particularly excited about the insides. The cardigan is put together with a simple zigzag stitch with navy blue thread on black fabric. :/ I didn't have any black thread when I started this, and I really wanted a cardigan made for the next day.


This has me gunning to play with more knits, and convinced me that I really should just get a serger. Knits are not as scary as the look, but I'm sure that sergers are exactly as complicated as they appear. I think my next big knits project will be a Colette Moneta.

In the tradition of me modeling my clothes on silly makeshift dress forms, here's a bicycle rack. You can see how the collar lies better in this image.

The fabric's quite sheer, and lovely to work with. I have no idea what the fiber content is, since I bought it at mystery fabric warehouse (aka Fabric Outlet). Here's a caltrain bench for you.
