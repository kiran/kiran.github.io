I'm trying to read papers more regularly. Here's a list of what I've read so far, with a quick tl;dr for each. Click through for the longer post (I haven't written them all up yet):

- [Harvest, Yield, and Scalable Tolerant Systems](/harvest-yield), Fox & Brewer

  tl;dr: characterize graceful degradation mechanisms in terms of harvest (the fraction of data reflected in the response) and yield (the probability of completing a request)

- Lessons from Giant-Scale Services, Brewer

- CAP Twelve Years Later: How the "Rules" Have Changed

- Towards robust distributed systems, Brewer's 2000 PODC keynote.

- Exterminate All Operating System Abstractions, Engler & Kaashoek

  tl;dr: operating systems should not abstract any physical resources.

- How Complex Systems Fail, Cook, 1998

  tl;dr: complex systems always run at the brink of failure; failures have no single root cause; "human error" is not a cause

- Rethink the Sync, Nightingale, Veeraraghavan, Chen, Flinn
